Simon is a PhD researcher investigating the application of artificial intelligence to digital systems that support risk assessment and decision-making, with a particular focus on geospatial contexts. His research is supervised by Dr Lavindra De Silva and conducted in collaboration with Ordnance Survey, the national mapping agency of Great Britain.

The research proposal explores semantic data interoperability solutions to improve communication and coordination across complex, multi-agency systems. It also involves developing methods that utilise knowledge graphs and geo foundation models to extract actionable intelligence from unstructured data with minimal supervision. The research sits at the intersection of AI, geospatial data, and digital infrastructure, and aims to bridge academic innovation with industry implementation.

Simon’s broader interests include applied machine learning, knowledge representation, geospatial AI, and the role of intelligent systems in shaping future digital infrastructure.
