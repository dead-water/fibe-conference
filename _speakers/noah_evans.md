Noah Cadwaladr Evans is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT). Noah’s work focuses on the development of a novel triaxial setup for investigating the mechanics of frozen soil. His project is supervised by Prof. Giulia Viggiani and Dr. Chris Menkiti of Geotechnical Consulting Group (GCG).

In 2023, Noah received his MEng in Civil Engineering with first class honours from the University of Bristol. During undergrad, he did an Erasmus+ placement year at Université Grenoble-Alpes in France; there, at Laboratoire 3SR, he conducted a research project developing an experimental method for investigating the susceptibility of soils to earthquake induced liquefaction.
