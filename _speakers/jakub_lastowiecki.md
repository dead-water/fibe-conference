Jakub is an MRes+PhD student researching the optimisation of different energy storage technologies to support intermittency of renewable generation and grid constraints. The project is supervised by Dr André Cabrera Serrenho and conducted within the EPSRC CDT in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2).

Prior to joining FIBE2, Jakub graduated from University College London (UCL) with first-class honours BEng in Electronic Engineering and Computer Science. His undergraduate dissertation examined economics and policy of wind power in his home country, Poland, and was supervised by Dr James Morris (now at TU/Eindhoven). He also briefly worked as an Electrical Engineer in clean hydrogen at BP.

Jakub's research interests revolve around energy systems with high renewable penetration and the challenges associated with it, such as long-term storage and grid stability, as well as evolving economics of the sector.
