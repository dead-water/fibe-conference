Monty is an MRes + PhD student at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT). His research interest focuses on improving energy efficiency within healthcare buildings, the results of which are intended to streamline the energy intensive ecosystem, improve the internal environment, as well as assessing the existing stock of healthcare buildings within the UK. This research is undertaken within the Energy Efficient Cities initiative, and is supervised by Professor Ruchi Choudhary.

Monty graduated from the University of Plymouth with a first-class BSc degree in Architectural Engineering, as well as prizes for both the highest mark and best final project. As part of this degree, Monty spent a year working full-time for the contractor ISG on a major hospital project, and placement work at Buro Happold on decarbonisation and energy efficiency projects. His dissertation focused on the application of energy-efficiency measures on hospital envelope design, Monty’s MRes and PhD projects are a culmination of his academic and professional experiences.

Outside of academia, Monty enjoys water polo and rowing.
