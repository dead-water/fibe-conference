Nandeesh Babanagar is an MRes + PhD candidate at the EPSRC Centre for Doctoral Training in Future Infrastructure and Built Environment (FIBE2 CDT).  He is supervised by Prof. Brian Sheil (academic) and David Preece and Peter Hewitt  (Laing O'Rourke). His research focuses on optimizing basement/ underground construction using real-time monitoring and digital twins.

Nandeesh holds a bachelor’s degree in Civil Engineering from M S Ramaiah Institute of Technology, Bangalore, India. Additionally, he earned a Master’s in Construction Technology and Management from the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Nandeesh has been a gold medalist in both the degrees he earned. During his master's studies, Nandeesh developed a specialized software program for geometric error corrections in precast segmental bridges, leveraging Building Information Modeling (BIM).

Before joining FIBE2 CDT, Nandeesh worked as a Project Control Engineer at Larsen and Toubro Construction in an Underground metro construction project for about 3 years. His practical experience is complemented by research endeavors at the Indian Institute of Technology Madras, where he dedicated a year to promoting precast concrete construction in India.
